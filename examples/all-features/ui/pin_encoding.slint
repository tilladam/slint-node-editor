// Application-specific pin ID generation
//
// This file contains a simple pin ID generation scheme used by this application.
// The generic library treats pin IDs as opaque integers - it never decodes them.
// Node ID and pin type are passed explicitly via callbacks, so the encoding
// here is only used to generate unique IDs, not to convey information.

    /// This encoding ensures uniqueness (up to 1000 pins per node).

    /// so this is purely for ID generation, not information encoding.
